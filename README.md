# FINANCIAL-MODELLING-STOCK-PORTFOLIO-MANAGEMENT
I am thrilled to share my latest project on Stock Portfolio Management & Financial Modeling! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡ This project allowed me to delve deep into financial analytics, combining theory with practical implementation. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what I achieved:
ðŸ”¹ Stock Analysis: Chose select stocks from Nifty50 and analyzed their high and low prices for 2020.
 ðŸ”¹ Risk & Returns: Calculated average returns, risks (standard deviation), and beta values for each stock.
 ðŸ”¹ CAPM Model: Applied the Capital Asset Pricing Model to estimate expected returns and assess stock performance.
 ðŸ”¹ Investment Strategy: Ranked stocks based on performance and designed an investment allocation strategy.
 ðŸ”¹ Visual Insights: Used pivot tables and dashboards to summarize findings and present insights visually.
This project sharpened my proficiency in Excel, from leveraging advanced formulas to creating dynamic dashboards. It also deepened my understanding of financial metrics like beta, CAPM, and risk-return analysis.
ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: This endeavor honed my ability to analyze market data, make informed investment decisions, and communicate insights effectivelyâ€”a skill set invaluable for businesses and investors alike.
ðŸ“Œ Check out my dashboard and insights in the attached visuals! Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts or feedback.
